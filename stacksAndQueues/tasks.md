Features

Node

- [x] Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node

Stack

- [x] Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- [x] This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
- [x] Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
- [x] Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node.
- [x] Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the node located on the top of the stack.

Queue

- [x] Create a Queue class that has a top property. It creates an empty queue when instantiated.
- [x] This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
- [x] Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
- [x] Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node.
- [x] Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the node located in the front of the stack.
- [ ] At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.
- [x] Be sure to follow your languages best practices for naming conventions.

Structure and Testing

- [x] Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- [ ] Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- [ ] Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
