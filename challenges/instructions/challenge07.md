Code Challenge
k-th value from the end of a linked list.

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called ll_kth_from_end
On your branch, create…
C#: Extend your LinkedList class according to the feature tasks below.
JavaScript: Extend your LinkedList class according to the feature tasks below
Python: Extend your LinkedList class according to the feature tasks below
Java: Extend your LinkedList class according to the feature tasks below
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
Example

Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, implement a method that finds the node at the middle of the Linked List.
