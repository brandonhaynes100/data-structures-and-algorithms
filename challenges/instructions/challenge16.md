Code Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called FizzBuzzTree
On your branch, create…
Java: Print the node values instead of changing the values.
C#: Create a method named FizzBuzzTree() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a folder named fizzBuzzTree which contains a file called fizz-buzz-tree.js
Python: a folder named fizz_buzz_tree which contains a file called fizz_buzz_tree.py
Java: a folder named FizzBuzzTree which contains a file called FizzBuzzTree.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.

For explicitly-typed languages: Ensure your node values are of type Object, to hold either strings or integers.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
