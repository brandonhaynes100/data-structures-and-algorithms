Code Challenge
Merge two linked lists.

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called ll_merge
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a new static method named Merge(LinkedList one, LinkedList two) with a return type of LinkedList outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a folder named llMerge which contains a file called ll-merge.js
Python: a folder named ll_merge which contains a file called ll_merge.py
Java: create a static utility method public static LinkedList merge(LinkedList one, LinkedList two) in your LinkedList class
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, implement another function that merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

Submission Instructions
Take a photo of your completed whiteboard, matching the example whiteboard layout
Copy your photo into an /assets directory in your repo
Give the image file the same name as the branch you are working on
Embed the image in your README.md documentation
Create a pull request from your branch to your master branch
In your open pull request, leave as a comment a checklist of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
Submitting your completed work to Canvas:
Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment
Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box
Add any additional comments you like about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment
Merge your branch into master, and delete your branch (don’t worry, the PR link will still work)
