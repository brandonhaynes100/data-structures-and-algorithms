Code Challenge
Insert and shift an array in middle at index

Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called array_shift
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a method named ArrayShift() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a folder named arrayShift which contains a file called array-shift.js
Python: a folder named array_shift which contains a file called array_shift.py
Java: a file called ArrayShift.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
Example
Input	Output
[2,4,6,8], 5	[2,4,5,6,8]
[4,8,15,23,42], 16	[4,8,15,16,23,42]
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition. You may round up in the event that the array has an odd number of indexes.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, write a second function that removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.
