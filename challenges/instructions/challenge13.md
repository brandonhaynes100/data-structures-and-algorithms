Code Challenge
Multi-bracket Validation.

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called multi-bracket-validation
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a method named MultiBracketValidation() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a folder named multiBracketValidation which contains a file called multi-bracket-validation.js
Python: a folder named multi_bracket_validation which contains a file called multi_bracket_validation.py
Java: a folder named multibracketvalidation which contains a file called MultiBracketValidation.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
On your main file, create…
C#: a function called bool MultiBracketValidation(string input)
JavaScript: a function called multiBracketValidation(input)
Python: a function called multi_bracket_validation(input)
Java: a method public static boolean multiBracketValidation(String input)
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Example
Input	Output
{}	TRUE
{}(){}	TRUE
()[[Extra Characters]]	TRUE
(){}[[]]	TRUE
{}{Code}[Fellows](())	TRUE
[({}]	FALSE
(](	FALSE
{(})	FALSE
Consider these small examples and why they fail.

Input	Output	Why
{	FALSE	error unmatched opening { remaining.
)	FALSE	error closing ) arrived without corresponding opening.
[}	FALSE	error closing }. Doesn’t match opening (.
