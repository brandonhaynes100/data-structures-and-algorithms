Code Challenge
First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called fifo_animal_shelter
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a method named FIFOAnimalShelter() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a folder named fifoAnimalShelter which contains a file called fifo-animal-shelter.js
Python: a folder named fifo_animal_shelter which contains a file called fifo_animal_shelter.py
Java: a folder named FIFOAnimalShelter which contains a file called FIFOAnimalShelter.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.
Stretch Goal
If a cat or dog isn’t preferred, return whichever animal has been waiting in the shelter the longest.

Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
