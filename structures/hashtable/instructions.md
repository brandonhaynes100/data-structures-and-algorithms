Implementation: Hash Tables
Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called hashtable
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a class named Hashtable.cs
JavaScript: a folder named hashtable which contains a file called hashtable.js
Python:a folder named hashtable which contains a file called hashtable.py
Java: a folder named Hashtable which contains a file called Hashtable.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Features
Implement a Hashtable with the following capabilities

a method/function named add that takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key and add the key and value pair to the table.
A method/function named Find that takes in the key and returns the value from key/value pair.
A method/function named contains that takes in the key and returns if the key exists in the table already.
A method/function named GetHash that takes in a key and returns the index in the array the key is stored.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
