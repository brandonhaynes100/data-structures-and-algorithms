Features
- [] Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node .
- [] Create a BinaryTree class
- [] Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which takes in a root node, and returns an array of the nodes.
- [] At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

- [] Create a BinarySearchTree class
- [] Define a method named add that adds a new node in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- [] Define a method named search that brings in a value of node, and returns the node with the desired value.

- [] Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
- [] Create a new branch called k-ary tree, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a k-ary tree, where each node can have any number of children.
