Lab 15: Trees
Implement a Tree
Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
Create a branch in your repository called tree
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a class named Tree.cs
JavaScript: a folder named tree which contains a file called tree.js
Python:a folder named tree which contains a file called tree.py
Java: a folder named Tree which contains a file called Tree.java
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Features
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

Create a BinarySearchTree class
Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
Create a new branch called k-ary tree, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a k-ary tree, where each node can have any number of children.

Submission Instructions
Create a pull request from your branch to your master branch
In your open pull request, leave as a comment a checklist of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
Submitting your completed work to Canvas:
Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment
Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box
Add any additional comments you like about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment
Merge your branch into master, and delete your branch (don’t worry, the PR link will still work)
